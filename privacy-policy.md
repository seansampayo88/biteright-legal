Privacy Policy — BiteRight
Last updated: 27 November 2025
BiteRight (“we,” “our,” or “the App”) provides tools to help users identify potential gluten-containing foods through image and text analysis. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains our data practices.
1. Medical Disclaimer
BiteRight is an informational tool, not a medical device. The App’s analysis is generated by artificial intelligence and may contain errors. It should never replace professional medical advice or verification with restaurant staff/manufacturers. We do not collect or store your health data or medical records.
2. Information We Collect & Process
We collect only data necessary to provide our core features:
a) Images & Camera Input: Photos you take are processed transiently. They are resized, stripped of EXIF metadata (location/device info), and sent securely to our AI provider (OpenAI) solely for analysis. We do not store your photos on our servers.
b) Text & Barcode Data: Text queries and barcode numbers are processed to retrieve ingredient information.
c) Location Data (Optional): If you grant permission, we use your device's general location (e.g., country/region) to improve the accuracy of product lookups and ingredient terminology. We do not track your movements or store your location history.
d) Technical Usage Data: We may collect anonymous crash reports and performance metrics provided by Apple (via Xcode) to help us fix bugs.
3. Third-Party Data Processing
To analyze your food, we transmit data to:
OpenAI: Images and text are sent to the OpenAI API. According to OpenAI’s API policies, data sent via the API is not used to train their models and is retained only for a limited time for abuse monitoring.
Product Databases: Barcode numbers may be sent to OpenFoodFacts or similar regional databases to retrieve ingredient lists.
4. Data Security
All data transmission between the App, our servers, and third-party APIs occurs over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).
5. No Data Selling
We do not sell your personal data, photos, or usage habits to advertisers or third parties. We do not use your data for marketing profiling.
6. Children’s Privacy
BiteRight is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
7. Your Rights & Contact
Since we do not create user accounts or store personal data on our servers, there is generally no personal data to delete. You may revoke Camera or Location permissions at any time in your device settings.
